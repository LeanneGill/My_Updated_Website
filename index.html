        <h1>Yoga Explained</h1>
          <p>Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that focuses on strength, 
              flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing.
              The main components of yoga are postures (a series of movements
              designed to increase strength and flexibility) and breathing.
              The practice originated in India and has been 
              adapted in other countries in a variety of ways. 
            The benefits of yoga can be found <a href="about.html" target="blank">here</a>

      <div class = "Origins">
      <h1>Where Did Yoga Originate?</h1>
        <p>The beginnings of Yoga were developed by the Indus-Sarasvati civilization in Northern India
           over <em>5,000 years</em>.
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali"target="_blank"><strong>Patanjali</strong> </a>is believed to be the father of yoga. </p>

     <div class = "Vinyasa">
<h2>Vinyasa</h2>
  <p>“Vinyasa” means linking breath with movement. 
        The postures are usually done in a flowing sequence, or "vinyasa flow." 
        The fluid movements can be memorized and done as a moving meditation, 
        almost like a dance.
  </p>
     </div>
     <div class = "Ashtanga">
<h2>Ashtanga Yoga</h2>
  <p>Ashtanga means “eight limbs” and encompasses a yogic lifestyle. 
      Most people identify Ashtanga as traditional Indian yoga.
      Like Vinyasa yoga, the Ashtanga yoga asanas (postures) synchronize
       breath with movement as you move through a series of postures.
    </p>
</div>
<div class = "Iyengar">
<h2>Iyengar Yoga</h2>
  <p>The emphasis on this practice is alignment in the asanas using breath 
      control through pranayama and the use of props (bolsters, blankets, 
      blocks and straps.) This style of yoga is usually taught without music and 
      at a slower pace designed to assist students to get deeper into the postures.

  <p>The Ashtanga yoga poses are performed more quickly and with added core 
      exercises and upper body work.

<div class = "Yin">
<h2>Yin Yoga</h2>
  <p>Yin yoga is a meditative practice that allows your body to become
       comfortable in a pose without doing any work (strength).
       It is also called Taoist yoga, and focuses on lengthening the connective 
       tissues within the body.
